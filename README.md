# Personal-Hobby-Project
This is my hobby project done to understand the basics of frontend development. Here, I created a very simple game of typing a few words within 10 seconds, which I was inspired from old 
Nepali typing game called Typeshala. This repositary consists of three files:
<li> index.html: The main html file </li>
<li> style.css: CSS stylesheet file </li>
<li> script.js: javascript file </li>
